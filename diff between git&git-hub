Git and GitHub are related but serve different purposes in the context of version control and collaboration in software development:

1. **Git**:
   - **Definition**: Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows developers to track changes to source code during software development.
   - **Functionality**: It manages and stores revisions of projects, enabling multiple developers to collaborate on codebases without overwriting each other's changes.
   - **Key Features**: Branching, merging, commit history, and local repositories.
   - **Usage**: Typically used locally on a developer's machine or on a central server to facilitate team collaboration.

2. **GitHub**:
   - **Definition**: GitHub is a platform that provides hosting for Git repositories.
   - **Functionality**: It adds a web-based graphical interface, along with additional features for collaboration such as issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools.
   - **Key Features**: Web-based repository hosting, code review tools, issue tracking, and wikis.
   - **Usage**: Developers use GitHub to store, share, and collaborate on Git repositories. It's widely used for open-source projects and by teams working on proprietary software.

**Differences**:
- **Git** is the version control system itself, whereas **GitHub** is a hosting service for Git repositories.
- Git can be used independently on a local machine or a private server, while GitHub provides a cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories publicly or privately.
- Git manages version control operations like commit, branch, merge, etc., locally or on a server, whereas GitHub enhances Git with web-based features for collaboration and project management.
- GitHub adds features like pull requests, issue tracking, and wikis, which are not inherently part of Git but are useful for team workflows and project management.

**Summary**: Git is the fundamental version control system that manages source code revisions, while GitHub extends Git with a web-based interface and collaborative tools for developers and teams.
